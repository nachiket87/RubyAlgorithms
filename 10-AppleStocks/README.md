### Trade Stocks / Greedy Algorithm

Write an efficient method that takes stock prices and
returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and
one sale of one share of stock yesterday.

#### For Example

stock prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get max profit(stock prices)

returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

#### VERY IMPORTANT NOTE

if you're planning on sorting it and taking the largest and smallest .. please don't .. genius.
The array is arranged based on time (and shorting isn't allowed). Do not modify the structure of the array.
