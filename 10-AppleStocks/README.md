### Trade Stocks / Greedy Algorithm

Write an efficient method that takes stock prices and
returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and
one sale of one share of stock yesterday.

#### For Example

stock prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get max profit(stock prices)

returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
