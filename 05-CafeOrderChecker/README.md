# CakeShop Ordering

I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

### Given all three arrays, write a method to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.
