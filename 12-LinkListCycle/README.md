## Check if LinkedList is a cycle

Single Linked List check if it's going in a circle (cycle)

A singly-linked list is built with nodes, where each node has:

node.next—the next node in the list.

node.value—the data held in the node. For example, if our linked list stores people in line at the movies, node.value might be the person's name.
